    <strong>Information Note !</strong>    </br></br>
    Please, type the date you plan to enter Kenya to the related field.</br></br>
    The validity period of your e-Visa will begin as of the date you enter Kenya.
    </br></br>
    Please note that the validity period is different than the period of stay. The period of stay cannot exceed the
    duration stated on the left-hand side. If you wish to stay longer, you must apply to your local Police Station for a
    residency permit.
    </br></br>
    If you exceed the duration stated on the left-hand side on a single entry without having a residency permit, you may
    be required to pay fines, deported, or banned from future travel to Kenya for a period of time.
    </br></br>
    The e-Visa system does not inform you the number of days you stay in Kenya. It is your responsibility to make sure
    that you do not overstay your visa.
